## About

Sombralternativa, Lda. is a company established in April 2022.

Despite its youth, it has staff members with over 16 years of experience in its field of operation, thus having the "know-how" of the structures we apply.

Our solar system company is committed to promoting renewable energy solutions for a sustainable future. This website serves as a platform to educate, engage, and connect with our customers and partners.

Sombralternativa, Lda. is the owner of the registered trademark FM Solar Systems and is dedicated to three areas of business, always related to coverings (Metal-textile, Solar, and Industrial). Sombralternativa, Lda. offers its clients a "turnkey" option, meaning it completes the entire project (civil construction, transportation, and assembly of the recommended structure for the specific location).
